Names: Lily McMullen, 
Species: 

Lily McMullen: My favorite species is a raccoon. They are a native species in North America, and they are mammals. They are not endangered, and their population is actually increasing. Raccoons are omnivores, and they can eat almost anything. This is why they are known for stealing scraps of food from garbage cans. Raccoons are able to get to all sorts of food that other animals can't because of their hand-like paws that can grab at lids of garbage cans, tree branches, and more. Many love raccoons and their cute appearance, but it can be dangerous to get close to them, because they can become aggressive if provoked.
