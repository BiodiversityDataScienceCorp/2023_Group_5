Species: 

Lily McMullen: My favorite species is a raccoon. They are a native species in North America, and they are mammals. They are not endangered, and their population is actually increasing. Raccoons are omnivores, and they can eat almost anything. This is why they are known for stealing scraps of food from garbage cans. Raccoons are able to get to all sorts of food that other animals can't because of their hand-like paws that can grab at lids of garbage cans, tree branches, and more. Many people love raccoons and their cute appearance, but it can be dangerous to get close to them, because they can become aggressive if they are provoked.

Names: Whitney Maxfield, 
Species: My favorite species is a Red-tailed Hawk. Red-tails are among the largest hawks in North America, second to the Ferruginous Hawk. They have a wingspan that averages a little over four feet and females are typically much larger than males. Red-tails eyesight is 8 times better than a humans! They are very cool birds. 

Name: Olivia Spagnuolo
My favorite species is a barn owl! Barn owls hunt at night, swooping back and forth low to the ground, looking for prey. They swallow their prey whole and cough up pellets when they are done digesting. Once, I stayed next to a barn where a family of barn owls lived, and I heard them all night and saw them looking for prey. Barn owls generally live in cavities (trees, old barns, etc) near large open areas of land.

Name: Nick Oliver
Species: Banded Woolly Bear / Isabella Tiger Moth
My favorite species is the Banded Woolley Bear, a common and distinctive caterpillar of a moth (Pyrrharctia Isabella) in family Erebidae. It is found generally in southern Canada and the U.S. Larvae are covered with thick hairs forming two thick black stripes with a brown-orange stripe in the middle. They are hardy generalists and consume many different kinds of plants and trees. Given that caterpillars emerge in the fall, they must deal with the process of overwintering; woolley bears manage this with the production of a cryoprotectant chemical which prevents tissue damage despite freezing solid. (This last fact is just so cool to me.) Seeing these fuzzy small invertebrate friends trucking around every fall is always a high point for the season, even if the beige spotted adult forms seem rarer.
