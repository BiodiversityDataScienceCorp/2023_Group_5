Species: 

Lily McMullen: My favorite species is a raccoon. They are a native species in North America, and they are mammals. They are not endangered, and their population is actually increasing. Raccoons are omnivores, and they can eat almost anything. This is why they are known for stealing scraps of food from garbage cans. Raccoons are able to get to all sorts of food that other animals can't because of their hand-like paws that can grab at lids of garbage cans, tree branches, and more. Many people love raccoons and their cute appearance, but it can be dangerous to get close to them, because they can become aggressive if they are provoked.

Species: Banded Woolly Bear / Isabella Tiger Moth
My favorite species is the Banded Woolley Bear, a common and distinctive caterpillar of a moth (Pyrrharctia Isabella) in family Erebidae. It is found generally in southern Canada and the U.S. Larvae are covered with thick hairs forming two thick black stripes with a brown-orange stripe in the middle. They are hardy generalists and consume many different kinds of plants and trees. Given that caterpillars emerge in the fall, they must deal with the process of overwintering; woolley bears' survival is managed by the production of a cryoprotectant chemical that prevents tissue damage.
